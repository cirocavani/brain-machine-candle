# A skier slides down a frictionless slope of height 40m and length 80m. What's the skier speed at the bottom?

# Solution:
# The potential energy of the skier is converted into kinetic energy as it slides down the slope. The formula for potential energy is mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and h is height. Since there's no friction, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy at the bottom of the slope. The formula for kinetic energy is 1/2mv^2, where v is velocity. We can equate these two formulas:
# mgh = 1/2mv^2
# Solving for v, we get:
# v = sqrt(2gh)
# Substituting the given values, we get:
# v = sqrt(2*9.8*40) = 28 m/s
# Therefore, the skier speed at the bottom of the slope is 28 m/s.

# A skier slides down a frictionless slope of height 40m and length 80m. What's the skier speed at the bottom?

# Solution:
# We can use the conservation of energy principle to solve this problem. The potential energy at the top is equal to the kinetic energy at the bottom, since there is no friction or air resistance. Therefore, we have:

# Potential energy = Kinetic energy
# mgh = (1/2)mv^2
# where m is the mass of the skier, g is the acceleration due to gravity, h is the height of the slope, and v is the speed at the bottom. Solving for v, we get:

# v = sqrt(2gh)
# Plugging in the values, we get:

# v = sqrt(2*9.8*40) = 24.25 m/s

# Therefore, the skier speed at the bottom is 24.25 m/s.
